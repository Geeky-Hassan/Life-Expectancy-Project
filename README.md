The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries The datasets, including [Life Expectancy (WHO)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who?fbclid=IwAR155pP1NyfjMQUfIxPN-s6oD06RWTAX9X0Gv5wkvPdVlUgP__Us2VNxujE), are made available to public for the purpose of health data analysis. The dataset [Life Expectancy (WHO)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who?fbclid=IwAR155pP1NyfjMQUfIxPN-s6oD06RWTAX9X0Gv5wkvPdVlUgP__Us2VNxujE) related to life expectancy, health factors for 193 countries has been collected from the same WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic data was collected from United Nation website.

Since the observations of this dataset are based on different countries, it will be easier for a country to determine the predicting factor which is contributing to lower value of life expectancy. This will help in suggesting a country which area should be given importance in order to efficiently improve the life expectancy of its population.

Then, we are now participating in exploring this dataset using Machine Learning technique in order to deduce the factors that affects the life expectancy the most, then utilizing the information obtained to predict the life expectancy given social and health factors of a area. 

More information about the dataset and the related issues can be found on: [Life Expectancy (WHO)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who?fbclid=IwAR155pP1NyfjMQUfIxPN-s6oD06RWTAX9X0Gv5wkvPdVlUgP__Us2VNxujE).
